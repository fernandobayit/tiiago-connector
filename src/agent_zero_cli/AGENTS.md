# Agent Zero CLI DOX

## Purpose

- Own the `agent_zero_cli` Textual application, headless frontend, connector transport/session client, slash commands, local state, host browser bridge, remote file/exec tools, model/profile/project commands, and computer-use orchestration.

## Ownership

- Root package files such as `app.py`, `client.py`, `config.py`, `connection.py`, `session.py`, `gateway.py`, `protocol.py`, `event_handlers.py`, `chat_commands.py`, `goal_commands.py`, `browser_commands.py`, `computer_use.py`, `computer_use_backend.py`, `host_browser*.py`, `remote_files.py`, `remote_exec.py`, `model_*.py`, `project_*.py`, `profile_commands.py`, `permissions_commands.py`, `self_update.py`, `textual_compat.py`, and `media_refs.py` are owned here.
- `headless/` is owned here and must remain importable without Textual.
- UI widgets, screens, and TCSS are owned by child docs in `widgets/`, `screens/`, and `styles/`.
- `assets/` is currently empty; keep it root-package owned until it becomes a durable asset boundary.

## Local Contracts

- `A0Client` owns HTTP, login/session cookies, Socket.IO setup, connector event registration, and the `a0-connector.v1` protocol constants.
- Keep `aiohttp.ClientWSTimeout` compatibility in `client.py` unless all supported aiohttp versions have been verified.
- `A0Client` advertises its effective `A0_WS_MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES` receive ceiling
  and consumes the Core ceiling from HTTP capabilities and `connector_hello`.
  Missing or invalid peer data must fall back to 4 MiB. Measure the complete
  encoded Socket.IO event before every call or result emit; oversized calls fail
  locally and oversized operation results become one structured
  `PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE` result without disconnecting.
- aiohttp rejects a WebSocket frame whose projected size is greater than or
  equal to `max_msg_size`; configure its parser bound to the advertised
  application ceiling plus one byte so the negotiated ceiling remains inclusive.
- `transfer_protocol=1` is the symmetric large-operation WebSocket contract.
  Keep ordinary payloads on the direct fast path; larger eligible requests and
  results use start, ordered 64 KiB chunks, end, and abort with declared size and
  SHA-256. Enforce the negotiated byte ceiling, four active inbound transfers,
  a 30-second idle timeout, and disk spooling above 1 MiB. A peer without the
  capability gets one structured `PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE` result, never legacy
  fragments or a transport disconnect.
- Associate active transfers with their existing chat context. Pause and reset
  abort that context before returning, intentional disconnect emits abort while
  the socket is still open, and peer abort or disconnect releases outbound and
  inbound state plus any spool file. Computer Use capture files and host-browser
  screenshot bytes must be rejected above 25 MiB before base64/JSON expansion.
- `AttachmentUpload.content` is bytes for clipboard/in-memory images or a
  `Path` for disk-backed images. Never turn a disk source back into a full-memory
  buffer before multipart upload. Bulk HTTP requests use their own size-scaled
  timeout and verify Core's size/SHA-256 receipt when advertised.
- `A0Client.download_file` streams Core's existing workdir download response to
  a same-directory `.partial-*` host file, verifies Content-Length and
  `X-Content-SHA256`, fsyncs, and atomically replaces the requested destination.
  A failure must preserve an existing destination and remove the partial.
- Remote file, exec, computer-use, and browser operation handlers must emit their `connector_*_op_result` event before follow-up metadata refresh work starts.
- Use the client after-result callbacks for browser and computer-use status refreshes so server-side pending operations resolve before any nested `connector_hello` round trip.
- Refresh the active chat tab metadata after context completion so server-side automatic chat renames become visible in the TUI.
- Completed TUI runs show a muted elapsed-time line immediately above the final response; the goal bar uses the same hour-aware duration format.
- Active TUI and headless runs emit one terminal-native ready-for-input notification by default. `A0_TERMINAL_NOTIFY=0` disables it; non-TTY and browser output stay silent, headless writes only to terminal stderr after final output settles, and ACP/gateway stdout contracts remain untouched.
- Launcher-tag headless mode is a strict one-shot/new-chat/JSONL contract. It
  creates the requested agent profile, accepts only bounded validated existing
  Agent Zero upload references, does not remember the chat, emits no raw context
  events, suppresses terminal notifications, and advertises local file, exec,
  Browser, and Computer Use capabilities as disabled so the existing Launcher
  gateway remains the only Host access provider. Its first-line
  `<!--a0-tag:v1;mode=replace|action-->` marker is stripped into one bounded
  `tag_result`; malformed or empty results use overlay-safe invalid metadata.
- `/clear` and F5 clear the visible conversation without resetting the current context; keep the initial Core greeting and Agent Zero banner visible.
- Model switcher state must use the backend's effective preset for display and identify the configured settings preset when clearing a chat override. The runtime editor updates the global `Default` preset, preserves untouched Utility and Embedding selections, and clears the active chat override after saving.
- `/computer-use on` is a human approval command. It must force `ComputerUseManager.rearm()` immediately instead of silently validating a saved restore token first.
- Computer Use must preserve explicit `window_id` targets through snapshot and type operations, and accept `window_id` as the top-level target for an explicit focus operation. Backends that advertise target-verified keyboard input fail closed unless the named window is active or focused.
- Wayland top-level focus may fall back from AT-SPI to an unambiguous `wmctrl` PID/title activation for XWayland windows, but success still requires AT-SPI active/focused verification.
- Keep the Wayland helper compatibility copy behavior-aligned with the packaged `a0-computer-use-wayland` helper; package-only bootstrap imports are the intentional difference.
- Wayland AT-SPI text offsets and integrity checks use Unicode character
  offsets, while `EditableText.insert_text` receives the UTF-8 byte length of
  its string. Keep replacement and rollback calls aligned with that split.
- Host-browser `open` must reuse an already-open tab with the same normalized URL before creating a new tab. Keep `list` and `set_active` workflows available for title-based or URL-based selection.
- Host-browser `evaluate` requires a non-empty `script` string for single and multi calls, matching Core. Reject missing input before page execution; preserve legitimate JavaScript null/undefined results.
- `evaluate_timeout_v1` advertises a host-enforced `evaluate_timeout_seconds` deadline (default 30; finite 0.1–60 seconds only) supplied by Core Browser settings. Playwright and direct CDP evaluate serialize per page and terminate execution in place. Keep the document when the original request settles within a 250 ms response grace; only unresolved execution (such as awaited promises) needs reload to commit. Report any reload or fallback closure in the timeout error. Preserve tab identity, cookies and storage; close only the affected page if recovery fails. Recovery, fallback closure and protocol detachment each have a 5-second bound. Safari evaluate fails before execution because its WebDriver backend cannot forcibly interrupt arbitrary JavaScript.
- `HostBrowserManager` tracks active evaluate operations, including multi, by operation and context IDs. The internal `cancel_evaluate` operation must acknowledge only after browser recovery completes; reject cross-context or unknown targets. Disconnect cancels and drains evaluates before closing sessions. Core peers without deadline capability negotiation must never be told that a transport timeout proves execution stopped.
- The allowlisted `open_remote_debugging` host-browser operation opens only an installed Chrome, Opera, or Edge executable at its fixed internal inspect page. It remains available while Host Browser is off so a deliberate Browser Settings action can complete setup, and it must never accept an arbitrary executable or URL.
- Remote host-browser operations may report status while Host Browser is off, but `ensure` and every effectful action must fail closed. Local `/browser` commands and Launcher-authorized setup may still prepare the browser through the direct manager API.
- Host-browser metadata must advertise stable browser choices, including discovered CDP browser IDs that survive `DevToolsActivePort` port/GUID changes. Incoming `browser_selection` / `host_browser_selection` values must select that browser instead of falling back to the automatic profile picker. Browser preparation may briefly wait for an existing browser's active-port file, and a failed discovered-CDP attach may retry only after that file advertises a different endpoint; explicit custom endpoints remain exact. Consent failures must tell the user to choose a Chrome profile and click Allow before retrying.
- The packaged A0 runtime includes the Python Playwright client for local-profile
  launch without bundling Chromium. Keep automatic preparation and `/browser
  repair` able to restore it in older or damaged CLI environments. Browser
  metadata must advertise dependency repair separately from profile preparation,
  and a repair attempt must run before reporting that no supported browser is
  installed.
- Explicit host-browser endpoints may be `host:port`, HTTP(S) CDP discovery addresses, or full DevTools WebSocket URLs. Resolve discovery addresses through `/json/version` on the host, preserve WebSocket path/query case, and fail explicitly instead of selecting another browser.
- WebSocket recovery in `connection.py` retries with the bounded `_RECOVERY_DELAYS_SECONDS` backoff and then keeps retrying on the steady `_RECOVERY_STEADY_DELAY_SECONDS` cadence indefinitely; after the initial ramp, Back and Try again remain available. A new connection, Back, or exit must cancel the prior recovery task before taking ownership. Recovery exits quietly when the active context changes and aborts when the client's `base_url` changes.
- Host-browser discovery covers Safari on macOS through the system
  `safaridriver`, plus major Chromium-family browsers with CDP-compatible
  profiles, including Chrome, Chromium, Edge, Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. Safari
  runs behind the existing `HostBrowserSession` operation surface, uses one
  exclusive automation context, never toggles remote automation itself, and
  rejects unsupported full-page screenshots explicitly. Before each Safari
  operation or cross-context exclusivity check, the connector checks both the
  `safaridriver` process and the active WebDriver session; stale state is closed
  through the existing runtime cleanup path and rebuilt under the session start
  lock.
- Host-browser status discovery on Windows must read native executable version
  metadata without running GUI browser binaries; opening an installed browser
  is an explicit preparation/use action, never a metadata side effect.
- `/browser list`, `/browser auto`, and direct `/browser <number|id|host:port|ws://...>` own CLI-side host-browser target selection for the current Agent Zero project.
- `/goal <objective>` creates the active chat goal through the builtin `_goal` plugin and sends the objective to the agent; `/goal update <text>` stays silent for active goals but resends an edited complete or blocked goal so work resumes; `/goal delete` only mutates goal state.
- The connected TUI command palette must merge effective `_commands` entries for the active chat with its local command registry. Local commands win name collisions; only server-confirmed extension commands may be forwarded through the chat path for Core-side resolution.
- Composer `@` completion reuses the Textual command palette and inserts plain references only. `@./` lists the bounded local workspace while `@/` lists only the active chat's container workspace; profile, skill, and MCP rows come from the scoped Agent Editor/tool-policy state.
- `/profile` keeps direct profile selection, adds quoted name plus instructions
  for quick creation, and uses the connector `agent_editor` capability for its
  create/edit screen rather than writing Agent Zero profile files locally. The
  exact `default` utility profile is not selectable or editable; an existing
  chat may still report it as current, and Create remains available when it is
  the only profile returned by older Core versions.
- `/permissions` opens a Connector-native Tools, MCPs, and Skills policy editor
  for the current profile and persists through Core's `agent_editor` API.
- Clipboard image paste uses `wl-paste` or `xclip` on Linux and the conditionally installed Pillow native reader on macOS and Windows.
- The CLI may remember host/context and computer-use settings, and protected web sessions may persist browser-style session cookies through the remembered-host/session flow. It may consume ephemeral `A0_USERNAME` and `A0_PASSWORD` environment variables for non-interactive login, but it must not persist usernames, passwords, connector tokens, API keys, or other secrets.
- Local Docker instance discovery should prefer launcher-owned friendly names
  from the `a0.launcher.instanceName` container label over generated Docker
  container or clone image names in visible picker/login text.
- Local Docker instance discovery should try reachable Unix-socket Docker API
  endpoints from `DOCKER_HOST`, Docker contexts, and known local runtimes such as
  Colima profiles before declaring the runtime unavailable.
- On Windows, local Docker instance discovery must not require `docker.exe` on
  the host PATH. Try reachable local Docker API endpoints such as the
  launcher/WSL Engine bridge before falling back to WSL-hosted Docker commands
  through `wsl.exe`.
- Remote workspace tools must respect their write/exec enablement flags and must not widen filesystem access accidentally.
- Remote workspace `write` uses same-directory fsync plus atomic replacement so
  an interruption cannot truncate an existing host file or expose partial new
  content. Preserve an existing file's mode and, when running as root, UID/GID
  before publication; metadata errors leave the original intact. New files
  retain private temporary-file permissions and the executing user's ownership.
- Remote workspace text reads must scan in fixed-size blocks, reject a
  binary-looking first block, and return no more than 2,000 lines or 256 KiB.
  Include explicit truncation/continuation metadata. Defensively reject write
  and patch text over 256 KiB before touching the destination; bulk and binary
  files belong on authenticated HTTP routes.
- Remote execution responses expose no more than 256 KiB of terminal output.
  Spill larger cleaned output atomically into the selected host workspace,
  return a final-byte tail with an explicit notice plus size/hash/path metadata,
  and bound prompt-pattern inspection before running regexes on long lines.
- Remote execution supports terminal/python/nodejs/output/reset, matching local
  code execution. Core's `input_remote` forwards terminal code with the internal
  `allow_running` flag; running sessions receive input, idle/missing sessions run
  it as a command, matching local input. Write-access and enablement gates still
  apply. The removed input runtime has no compatibility alias.
- POSIX shell commands and completion bookkeeping form one parsed brace group,
  so child stdin receives only subsequent input, while cwd and shell variables
  remain available to the next command in the same session.
- `file_browser.py` supplies binary-safe `files_*` operations for CLI and Launcher sessions. Advertise `file_browser: 1` and `root_path`; require the same root on each request. Host uploads use authenticated streamed HTTP with Core-supplied sizes and no independent ceiling, with size/hash checks and a same-directory staging file. Recheck connection identity, workspace and write permission before atomic publication; refuse overwrites and stale Editor revisions. Core enforces its configurable Editor text limit (10 MiB by default). No execution capability is required.
- Host downloads use the same multipart streaming/integrity helper with an opaque `transfer_token`, targeting the protected File Browser receipt API instead of creating chat attachments. Both CLI and Launcher dispatch HTTP operations asynchronously through RemoteFileUtility; ordinary text-tool operations retain their own bounded protocol.
- Textual compatibility guards live in `textual_compat.py`. Install them only on the interactive TUI startup path so `a0 headless` remains Textual-free.
- `image_render.py` owns the interactive-only terminal-image adapter. It probes and captures terminal rendering capabilities before `App.run()`, while headless and gateway startup paths must not import it or `textual-image`. Automatic selection may trust a direct terminal's authoritative capability advertisement, but must reject known partial implementations such as Warp's Kitty support without the Unicode virtual placements required by `textual-image`; terminal multiplexers do not inherit that trust. If no complete TGP or Sixel path is available, automatic and unsupported forced native modes select `off`; only explicit or preview-forced half-cell mode constructs the real half-cell widget factory. Ordinary pytest launches keep their library-free half-cell renderer before native probes. Widget callers fit a `CellBox` before `create_widget()`, and native renderer failures become unavailable placeholders rather than pixelated fallback images. Visible Sixel widget trees are redrawn together after transcript viewport changes because Sixel pixels are not terminal-retained; other renderers no-op that hook. Cleanup accepts `None` and suppresses protocol release/removal failures after caller bookkeeping is cleared.
- `image_store.py` owns streamed, authenticated same-origin image loading and memory-only display-surface caching. It uses the existing `A0Client` HTTP session, fetches only traversal-free `/a0/` paths, accepts only validated raster payloads, limits encoded data to 25 MiB and decoded dimensions to 32 million pixels, permits four concurrent fetch/load operations while serializing full-resolution Pillow decode, downsamples before EXIF transpose and RGBA/RGB composition, holds the decoder permit until a canceled worker thread completes, and maintains a 64 MiB LRU of independently-owned Pillow surfaces.
- `ImageAsset` is the mutable six-field `cache_key`, `mime_type`, `image`, `width`, `height`, and `cost_bytes` contract. Clones preserve every field with an independently owned loaded surface, and `ImageStore.cache_bytes` is read-only accounting.
- `media_refs.py` owns immutable image-reference extraction. It only normalizes supported connector metadata, attachments, Markdown, bounded data URIs, and same-origin `/api/image_get` references; it performs no I/O and never accepts arbitrary external origins or paths. Browser media is limited to browser-marked `tool_start`/`tool_output` events, recognizing persisted Core `_tool_name` metadata and the existing `tool_name` compatibility shape while rejecting tool thoughts and other tools.
- `event_handlers.py` attaches normalized image references only after each event has rendered its primary/status entry. `AgentZeroCLI` owns `ImageEntry` load workers, applying an asset only while the entry generation remains mounted in its source context; stale assets are closed. Workers capture context, client, store, host, and lifecycle epoch before scheduling and revalidate before both fetch and apply.
- Clear and context switches advance the image-load epoch and cancel pending image loads while retaining the same-host cache. A host change, disconnect (including login disconnect before its first await), and exit advance it before cleanup; host change clears the store before replacing `client.base_url`, while disconnect and exit clear the chat log before clearing the store. Headless and gateway launch paths remain renderer-free.
- Transcript image ownership is browser tool metadata for browser screenshots,
  user messages for attachments, and assistant messages for assistant metadata
  or Markdown. Keep the connector event schema unchanged and do not create a
  duplicate browser screenshot event.
- `a0 gateway` is also Textual-free. Its `ConnectorSession` branch authenticates
  and publishes `connector_hello` without a chat context, handles reconnects
  without creating chats, and serves file, exec, browser, and Computer Use
  operations. It requires both Launcher gateway capabilities before announcing
  readiness.
- Gateway control uses JSONL stdin/stdout for status, scope replacement,
  browser preparation, Computer Use setup/rearm, error, and shutdown messages.
  On Windows, the `a0` entrypoint configures the gateway and headless machine
  protocol streams as UTF-8 before either mode reads or writes JSONL; the
  interactive Textual startup path keeps its native terminal stream handling.
  Commands that expect a result carry `request_id`, and every nested manager
  failure must become a failed correlated gateway result rather than a success
  wrapper. `computer_use_setup_v1` gates the staged setup command independently
  from the base Launcher gateway contract. Saved
  web sessions are preferred, then ephemeral `A0_USERNAME`/`A0_PASSWORD` login;
  secrets must never appear in arguments or JSONL output. Gateway scope state
  must not overwrite interactive CLI preferences. A Launcher gateway maps the
  copied Computer Use `allow` mode to `persistent` so a natural desktop action
  may keep the platform approval prompt open without changing the interactive
  CLI's saved mode. On macOS, permission checks and polling must use fresh helper
  processes, prompt Accessibility before Screen Recording at most once per
  attempt, and finish within 120 seconds so the original Agent Zero operation
  can continue under its existing timeout. Preserve an HTTP(S) host's
  reverse-proxy base path while rejecting embedded URL credentials.
- Gateway shutdown owns complete cleanup of remote process groups, host-browser
  sessions, Computer Use sessions, and the Socket.IO connection. Emergency
  disconnect ends the current lease and exits cleanly rather than reconnecting.
- Disabling the gateway master switch or an individual long-lived capability
  closes its active execution, browser, or Computer Use sessions before the
  control acknowledgement is returned.
- Launcher gateway scopes expose file reading and writing separately. File
  writing requires file reading, and Code execution requires file writing;
  older gateway payloads with only `files` retain their previous read/write
  meaning. The command-line contract uses `file_read` for the new read-only
  selection and keeps legacy `files` read/write so a CLI update cannot silently
  downgrade an older Launcher.
- `a0_tag_v1` is an independently advertised feature for supported Wayland and
  macOS Computer Use backends. Its
  correlated commands list profiles, capture one explicit foreground tag,
  upload a uniquely named screenshot only when the backend supplies a verified
  bounded active-window artifact, apply a revalidated reply, and release the
  opaque target. Current Wayland capture is explicitly text/accessibility-only;
  do not turn an unverified monitor crop into an attachment. Capture/apply
  require the existing Computer Use scope; release remains best-effort during
  teardown and stops the private tag portal session without ending the gateway
  lease. These private manager calls must not enter the agent-visible Computer
  Use action set.
  Wayland tag focus resolution is scoped to the active top-level window before
  choosing a readable focused descendant so stale inactive AT-SPI focus cannot
  capture or revalidate the wrong application.
  The private macOS `launcher-tag` session requires Accessibility but must not
  require Screen Recording: without the latter it returns bounded text/AX
  context and an explicit unavailable screenshot reason. Ordinary Computer Use
  sessions retain staged Accessibility and Screen Recording setup.
- `a0_tag_upload` is a correlated, Computer-Use-gated gateway command for paths
  selected explicitly by Launcher's native chooser. Accept only bounded
  absolute paths, expand directories without following nested symlinks, cap
  file count and bytes, reuse `A0Client.upload_attachments`, and return only
  `/a0/usr/uploads/` references. It is not an agent-visible file-read action and
  must never scan a workspace or user directory implicitly.

## Work Guidance

- Query widgets with typed `query_one` calls, for example `self.query_one("#message-input", ChatInput)`.
- Route activity state through app-level helpers such as `_set_activity(...)` and `_set_idle()` rather than reaching into `ChatInput` from scattered event handlers.
- Keep `AgentZeroCLI` as the composition/orchestration surface; put command behavior in the focused command modules when that pattern already exists.
- Normalize server payloads defensively. The connector must tolerate older or partially-capable Agent Zero Core builds with user-facing errors.
- Keep command names, footer shortcuts, slash commands, and README/docs in sync when user-facing behavior changes.

## Verification

- Broad CLI checks: `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_app.py tests/test_client.py -v`.
- Remote tools: `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_remote_files.py tests/test_remote_exec.py -v`.
- Browser bridge: `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_host_browser.py -v`.
- Computer use orchestration: `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_computer_use.py tests/test_computer_use_contract.py -v`.
- Install/update/config paths: `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_entrypoint.py tests/test_installers.py tests/test_self_update.py tests/test_instance_discovery.py -v`.

## Child DOX Index

- `widgets/AGENTS.md` - Reusable Textual widgets and chat rendering surfaces.
- `screens/AGENTS.md` - Modal and full-screen Textual screen contracts.
- `styles/AGENTS.md` - TCSS layout and visual styling rules.

- `file_browser_paths.py` anchors POSIX Files operations to directory descriptors with no-follow opens. Windows locks parent directories against replacement and checks final file handles for workspace containment. HTTP reads snapshot held source descriptors into private temporary files; writes stage privately before descriptor-relative publication. Recheck current scopes before upload/publication. Exclusive rename must not replace a racing destination. Validate platform-specific paths natively before claiming Windows/macOS race coverage.
