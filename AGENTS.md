# Agent Zero Connector - DOX Rail

## Purpose

- Define the project-wide DOX contract for `a0-connector`.
- Keep every source file, durable document, workflow, and artifact understandable from this root `AGENTS.md` plus the nearest child `AGENTS.md`.
- Preserve the connector's two-part product shape: the `a0` Textual CLI in this repo, and the builtin `_a0_connector` Agent Zero Core plugin outside this repo.

## Ownership

- This root doc owns repo-wide behavior, safety, verification, top-level files, packaging metadata, installers, and the Child DOX Index.
- Top-level files owned here include `README.md`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `install.sh`, `install.ps1`, `test_context_patch.txt`, `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, and any future root-level release or packaging files.
- Child docs own the scoped rules for `src/`, `packages/`, `tests/`, `docs/`, `devtools/`, `requirements/`, and `constraints/`.
- Generated or local-only artifacts such as `.venv/`, `.pytest_cache/`, `tmp/`, `.tmp-tests/`, `textual.log`, `__pycache__/`, and generated snapshots are not durable DOX scopes.

## Local Contracts

### DOX Framework

- `AGENTS.md` files are binding work contracts for their subtrees.
- Before editing, read this root doc, identify every path you expect to touch, then read every `AGENTS.md` from the repo root to each target path.
- Do not rely on memory. Re-read the applicable DOX chain in the current session before editing.
- If a parent `AGENTS.md` lists a child whose scope contains the path, read that child and continue from there.
- The nearest `AGENTS.md` controls local details. Child docs may specialize parent rules but may not weaken DOX itself.
- After every meaningful change, run a DOX pass: re-check changed paths against the DOX chain, update the nearest owning docs and affected parent or child indexes, remove stale or contradictory instructions, and run relevant verification.
- Update docs when a change affects purpose, ownership, structure, workflow, contracts, inputs, outputs, permissions, constraints, side effects, artifacts, quality standards, communication preferences, or any `AGENTS.md` scope/index.
- Small edits that do not change behavior or contracts may leave docs unchanged, but the DOX pass still happens.

### Product Contracts

- Tech stack: Python 3.10+, Textual 8+, `httpx`, `aiohttp`, `python-socketio` / Engine.IO.
- Windows installer bootstrapping downloads the uv installer to a unique temporary
  `.ps1` file and runs it with PowerShell `-File` and `RemoteSigned`, checking the
  exit code and cleaning up afterward. Do not use inline download-and-execute
  pipelines or `ExecutionPolicy Bypass` in this path.
- Run the TUI with `a0` or `./.venv/bin/python -m agent_zero_cli`.
- Launcher direct-connect path is `a0 --host <local-url> --no-docker-discovery --connect`; `--host` selects the target URL, `--no-docker-discovery` skips Docker discovery, and `--connect` connects immediately instead of opening the host picker.
- Run the plain stdin/stdout connector with `a0 headless`; use
  `a0 headless --print` for one-shot pipe-friendly runs.
- On Windows, `a0 gateway` and `a0 headless` explicitly use UTF-8 stdin,
  stdout, and stderr so their machine protocols do not inherit the ANSI code
  page from Launcher-owned pipes. Interactive TUI stream handling is unchanged.
- Launcher-owned A0 Tag requests use the capability-silent
  `a0 headless --launcher-tag --new-chat --output jsonl --print` path with an
  explicit agent profile and optional existing `/a0/usr/uploads/` attachment
  references. The prompt remains on stdin, the tagged client advertises no host
  tools of its own, and its final replace/action marker becomes one normalized
  `tag_result` JSONL record before `complete`.
- Active TUI and headless terminal sessions emit one ready-for-input notification
  per completed run by default. `A0_TERMINAL_NOTIFY=0` disables it; headless
  writes notification bytes only to terminal stderr so stdout stays pipe-safe.
- Run the Launcher-owned tools-only connector with `a0 gateway`. It is a
  Textual-free, newline-delimited JSON stdin/stdout contract and must not create,
  select, or subscribe to a chat.
- Interactive transcript images use `A0_CLI_IMAGE_MODE=auto|tgp|sixel|halfcell|off`.
  Automatic selection combines reliable terminal capability advertisements,
  live protocol probes, and compatibility exclusions to select TGP or Sixel;
  without a complete native protocol it preserves the pre-image transcript and
  performs no image loading. This is terminal-capability based regardless of
  whether the shell is Bash, Zsh, or PowerShell. A false-positive native probe
  must fail locally without falling back to pixelated half-cell output.
  Images open in their expanded complete-aspect view and may be collapsed with
  click, Enter, or Space.
  Only explicit `halfcell`, browser preview, and SVG snapshot paths use a real
  half-cell widget without native protocol probes; pytest's ordinary TUI path
  remains library-free. Preview output is layout evidence and does not establish
  native TGP/Sixel acceptance. Keep automated CLI, Core deployment, and
  capable-terminal visual evidence as separate surfaces.
- Gateway release 2.6 adds `computer_use_setup_v1`: correlated setup commands,
  staged macOS Accessibility then Screen Recording approval, and fresh-helper
  polling bounded to 120 seconds so the initiating agent tool call can resume.
- Supported Wayland, macOS, and Windows gateways may also advertise `a0_tag_v1`. Its correlated
  profile, capture, apply, and release commands reuse the authenticated gateway
  client and existing Computer Use grant. A backend may return a verified,
  bounded active-window PNG; the gateway gives each such upload a unique name
  and never returns base64 through Launcher JSONL. The current Wayland helper
  reports text/accessibility-only context because GNOME does not expose
  trustworthy native-window screen bounds to AT-SPI callers. Release and failed
  capture stop the private tag session, including its Wayland portal resources,
  while the outbound gateway lease remains connected.
- The same `a0_tag_v1` gateway accepts explicitly user-selected absolute file
  or folder paths through its correlated upload command, reads no implicit
  location, expands folders to bounded regular files, and uploads them through
  the existing authenticated client. Launcher receives only Agent Zero upload
  references; host paths and file bytes never enter the palette renderer.
- Release installs include the Python Playwright client needed to launch a host
  Chromium-family profile. They do not download a separate Chromium binary;
  Browser setup and `/browser repair` remain recovery paths for older or damaged
  CLI environments.
- On macOS, host Browser choices also include Safari through Apple's bundled
  `/usr/bin/safaridriver` W3C WebDriver. Safari uses a dedicated automation
  window, permits one Agent Zero browser context at a time, and never enables
  Safari's remote-automation setting silently. Its WebDriver screenshot path is
  viewport-only and must reject full-page requests explicitly. If the driver
  exits or Safari invalidates its WebDriver session, the next browser operation
  must replace the stale runtime instead of reusing it.
- Browser Settings may ask the connected CLI to open the fixed remote-debugging
  setup page in an installed Chrome, Opera, or Edge browser. Keep this action
  strictly allowlisted and available before Host Browser itself is enabled.
- Use Linux commands and paths by default. Prefer `./.venv/bin/python`, not Windows-only virtualenv paths.
- UI preview is the primary loop for TUI work: `./.venv/bin/python devtools/serve.py` at `http://localhost:8566`.
- The CLI talks to Agent Zero through the connector protocol `a0-connector.v1`, HTTP routes under `/api/plugins/_a0_connector/v1/`, and Socket.IO events on namespace `/ws` with `connector_*` event names.
- Large operation requests/results use negotiated `transfer_protocol=1` start,
  ordered 64 KiB chunk, end, and abort events. Peers without that capability
  receive one structured size error; they must never receive a partial legacy
  chunk stream or be disconnected by an oversized application payload.
- CLI and Core advertise `capabilities.ws_max_payload_bytes`; outbound Socket.IO
  events are measured after serialization and rejected before dispatch when they
  exceed the peer ceiling. Missing or invalid capability data uses the 4 MiB
  legacy floor. Bulk payloads belong on authenticated HTTP transfer routes.
- HTTP attachment uploads keep disk sources file-backed, use size-scaled
  per-request timeouts, and verify Core's ordered size/SHA-256 receipts. Core
  downloads stream into a same-directory host partial and become visible only
  after Content-Length/SHA-256 verification and atomic replacement.
- Remote text reads are a bounded control-plane preview: stream the source,
  reject binary-looking input, return at most 2,000 lines or 256 KiB with
  continuation metadata, and direct complete/binary content to authenticated
  HTTP. Remote write and patch payloads are capped at 256 KiB on both peers.

### Plugin Backend

- The builtin `_a0_connector` plugin is not vendored here. It lives in Agent Zero Core under `plugins/_a0_connector`.
- For this workstation, the real Agent Zero Core plugin repo is `/home/eclypso/a0/agent-zero/plugins`.
- When testing Dockerized Agent Zero backend behavior, verify the exact live runtime named for the task instead of assuming a fixed localhost port.
- When explicitly asked or approved to change plugin/backend code outside this repo, keep the live runtime copy and `/home/eclypso/a0/agent-zero/plugins` in sync.
- Plugin code must not import `agent`, `initialize`, or `helpers.projects` at module level. Import Agent Zero internals inside handler methods.
- In plugin `api/ws_connector.py`, `from_sequence` is a log-output cursor (`LogOutput.end`), not a connector event sequence. Do not mix cursor and event sequence domains.
- Large chat history must replay through bounded `connector_context_snapshot` pages before live streaming. Do not send full transcripts in a single WebSocket frame or turn old history into live `connector_context_event` messages.

### Safety And Permissions

- Allowed without asking: read files, edit repo source/docs/tests/devtools/requirements/constraints/AGENTS docs, run devtools scripts, and run pytest.
- Ask before installing new dependencies, editing external Agent Zero plugin/backend files, deleting files outside normal generated outputs, or making git commits/pushes.
- Never hardcode API keys, tokens, passwords, cookies, or connector secrets.
- Do not persist usernames, passwords, connector tokens, or API keys. Protected
  Agent Zero web sessions may persist browser-style session cookies only through
  the existing remembered-host/session flow.
- Never use destructive git commands such as `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless the user explicitly asks.
- Preserve user work. If the worktree contains unrelated changes, leave them alone.

## Work Guidance

- Prefer `rg` and `rg --files` for search.
- Use `apply_patch` for manual file edits.
- Keep code enterprise/research quality: minimal, adapted to local style, robust, and testable.
- Prefer existing project patterns and helper APIs over new abstractions.
- For structured data, use structured parsers/APIs where available.
- Keep UI changes visually verified. Text must fit, avoid incoherent overlap, and remain usable in the Textual browser preview.
- Record durable user behavior preferences in this root doc or the closest relevant child doc.

## User Preferences

- The operating shell is `bash` on Ubuntu Linux.
- Prefer Linux paths and command examples unless a Windows or macOS-specific file requires platform-specific wording.
- Treat plugin/backend discussion as connected to the explicitly named Dockerized Agent Zero runtime when one is in scope.
- Always mirror live Agent Zero Core plugin runtime changes into `/home/eclypso/a0/agent-zero/plugins` when backend/plugin changes are in scope.
- Aim for solutions that unite rigor and elegance: concise, technically strong, and beautiful in the small details.

## Verification

- Full test suite: `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -v`.
- If anyio backend issues appear: `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -v -p anyio --anyio-backends=asyncio`.
- UI preview: `./.venv/bin/python devtools/serve.py`.
- Static TUI snapshot: `./.venv/bin/python devtools/snapshot.py`.
- Dependency lock check, when dependency files change and `uv` is available: `./.venv/bin/python devtools/lock_dependencies.py --check`.
- Opt-in 16/32/64 MiB transport soak: `A0_RUN_LARGE_PAYLOAD_SOAK=1 ./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_client.py -m large_payload_soak -v`.

## TI•IA•GO Brand Layer

- This fork applies a mechanical brand layer on top of upstream: package/CLI name `tiiago` (alias `a0` kept), `TI•IA•GO` titles, URLs pointing at `fernandobayit/tiiago-connector`.
- The layer lives in `devtools/apply_tiiago_brand.py` and is re-applied by `.github/workflows/sync-upstream.yml` after every upstream merge; run it manually with `python3 devtools/apply_tiiago_brand.py`.
- Do NOT rename shared protocol identifiers: plugin `_a0_connector`, protocol `a0-connector.v1`, `/api/plugins/_a0_connector/v1/` routes, `A0_*`/`AGENT_ZERO_*` env vars, `constraints/a0-*.txt` paths, or the `agent_zero_cli` package. They are the contract with Agent Zero Core.
- Fork-only additions: `DEFAULT_HOST` compiled to `https://a0.bayit.me` (client.py), `TIIAGO_DEFAULT_HOST` (host fallback override), and `TIIAGO_AUTOCONNECT` (auto-connect on startup, default ON; set `=0` to disable). Auto-connect lands on the login panel when no saved session exists.
- Fork-only defaults: remote exec (`AGENT_ZERO_REMOTE_EXEC_ENABLED` / `A0_REMOTE_EXEC`) and local Computer Use (`AGENT_ZERO_COMPUTER_USE_ENABLED`, trust mode `allow`) ship enabled on first run. Startup teardown must not rewrite persisted enablement; toggles and explicit opt-outs (`=0`) stay authoritative. Enforced by brand patches on `config.py`, `computer_use.py`, and `docs/configuration.md`.
- Fork-only intro banner: the chat-log login banner, compact, and tiny variants render TI•IA•GO (`src/agent_zero_cli/widgets/splash_view.py` via `build_agent_zero_banner_widget` consumers in `chat_log.py`); internal identifiers stay upstream-named as internal contracts. Enforced by a brand patch.
- Fork-only login focus fix: background Docker discovery must not rewrite the splash or move focus while the login stage is active (`app.py` stage guards in `_start_instance_discovery` / `_apply_instance_discovery_result`), `SplashLoginPanel.set_credentials` never clobbers focused username/password fields, and `SplashView.set_state` re-applies primary focus only on stage change or when focus does not already belong to the splash subtree (`_splash_owns_focus`). Enforced by brand patches.
